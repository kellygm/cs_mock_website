# CS 343: Web Applications Project
> Grade: B <br>
> Partner: Reed Kilday
## Project Description
This project covered the second half of the Fall 2023 semester to demonstrate the learned skills we have developed throughout the first half of the semester by creating a website. My partner and I chose to create a website to help connect aspiring computer science students with a platform to communicate with each other, locate resources, and receive the latest news regarding the field. For a more in-depth description of the project requirements, you can refer to the public class website here: https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/343/projects/project.shtml
